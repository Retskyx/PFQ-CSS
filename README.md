## Changes

- <ins>Fields Backgrounds</ins> - Changed all images to ones that aren't so "busy". Images of the types' logo, solid colors, minimal details.

- <ins>Egg Labels</ins> - Original has not been updated since March 2024. It ended at Fezandipiti (Gen 9), Humbee (PFQ Exclusive), & Deinglitch (PFQ Variant). I have updated it from then until July 29, 2025.
